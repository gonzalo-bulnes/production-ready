Feedback and contributions are welcome. Please feel welcome to get in touch, [opening an issue](https://github.com/gonzalo-bulnes/production-ready/issues) or otherwise, to share what worked well for you and what could be improved.

The content describes my approach, today, which makes it of course quite personal. Nonetheless, I am particularly interested in knowing if the way ideas are presented and the tone seem appropriate to you, or how they could be improved.
